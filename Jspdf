In this example, we import the jsPDF library and its autotable plugin. We then define a function called generatePdf() that creates a new instance of jsPDF and gets the HTML element that we want to export as PDF. We also define an object called specialElementHandlers that tells jsPDF which elements to ignore when exporting the HTML as PDF. Finally, we call the fromHTML() method of jsPDF and pass in the HTML element that we want to export as PDF.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Received message. You can use jsPDF library to convert HTML to PDF in React. Here's an example: ```typescript import jsPDF from "jspdf"; import "jspdf-autotable"; const generatePdf = () => { const doc = new jsPDF(); const elementHTML = document.getElementById("element-to-export"); const specialElementHandlers = { "#element-to-export": (element, renderer) => { return true; }, }; doc.fromHTML(elementHTML, 15, 15, { width: 170, elementHandlers: specialElementHandlers, }); doc.save("pdfName.pdf"); }; ``` In this example, we import the jsPDF library and its autotable plugin. We then define a function called `generatePdf()` that creates a new instance of jsPDF and gets the HTML element that we want to export as PDF. We also define an object called `specialElementHandlers` that tells jsPDF which elements to ignore when exporting the HTML as PDF. Finally, we call the `fromHTML()` method of jsPDF and pass in the HTML element that we want to export as PDF. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
